### A repository of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch

I decided to do this project as a sort of refresher on these algorithms and as a personal challenge.  
There is only one rule: *I can't use functions (except for mathematical or graphical ones) that I have not defined previously*.  
Therefore, the notebooks are meant to be read in order, as I define notation and functions, although it should be possible to not follow the order, since I try to
use the same notation as in the Stanford's Machine Learning Coursera course.
